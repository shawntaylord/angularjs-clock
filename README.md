angularjs-clock
===============

Simple clock made with simple implementations of Angular.js components.

This application was created with the intent to learn some basic implementations and aspects of SVG, Angular.js, and CSS3. While not a very intensive project, it is and was a great way to learn the basics to these three components.

#This project covered the following ideas:#

###Angular.js###
1.  Basic Angular.js application layout
2.  Usage of ng-repeat module
3.  Creation of simple directives (as elements, specifically)
4.  Simple controller creation
5.  Data-binding
6.  Usage of partial templates

###SVG###
1.  How to create simple shapes (understanding their corresponding attrs.)
2.  Grouping sets of shapes

###CSS3###
1.  Transorm style
2.  Touch screen properties
3.  Use of perspective

###Javascript###
1.  setInterval() vs. setTimeout()
